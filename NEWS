BUG FIXES

* Fixed regression with help messages when running Sugar 0.84 (#2676)
* Fixed problem with selected turtle reverting back to default turtle (#2687)
* Fixed problem with camera block graphic in trash (#2678)
* Fixed regression with camera_plugin after refactoring (#2689)

PYTHON CODE CHANGE

* Userdefined code gets TurtleWindow instance rather than LogoCode
  instance as first argument. This change was made in order to better
  accommodate and better parallel the new plugin mechanism. Most
  likely, you had been referencing tw, the TurtleWindow instance from
  lc, the LogoCode instance, e.g., lc.tw. Now you can reference tw
  directly, e.g., tw. To reference lc, use tw.lc. Under most
  circumstances, Turtle Art will detect when myblock is looking for lc
  rather than tw and it will pass the correct argument.
